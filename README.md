### Project Name : Todo List Web Application

The Todo List Web Application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently by allowing them to add, track, and complete tasks in a simple and visually engaging way. The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can input tasks, set deadlines, and see their progress in real-time through a dynamic progress bar.

This application focuses on functionality and usability, providing users with an easy way to organize their daily tasks and deadlines. The progress bar adds a motivational element by visually tracking the percentage of tasks completed.

#### Key Features:

1. **Task Management**:

    - Users can input tasks by providing a description and selecting a due date using a simple form. Each task is displayed in a list format, making it easy to view and manage.
    - The task description is entered into a text input field (#taskInput), while the deadline is selected using a date picker input (#dateInput).

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   
    - A progress bar is displayed at the top of the page. This bar fills as tasks are marked as completed (the JavaScript functionality is responsible for this part).
    - The progress percentage is shown as text (e.g., "0% Complete"), which updates dynamically as users complete tasks.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   
    - The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it works well across different devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

4. **Intuitive User Interface**:
   
    - The interface is clean and simple. It allows users to quickly add tasks and track their progress without unnecessary distractions.

### Purpose:

This Todo List app serves as a tool for personal task management, helping users stay organized and motivated. By allowing users to track their progress visually, it encourages completion of tasks and promotes productivity. It is an ideal project for understanding the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be easily extended with additional features like task deletion, task editing, or saving tasks in local storage.

This project provides a foundation for building more advanced task management tools and serves as a great introduction to web development concepts.
